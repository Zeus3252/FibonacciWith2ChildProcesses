# FibonacciWith2ChildProcesses
What the program does in short: Spawning 2 children processes from a parent process, with one performing the Iterative Fibonacci Algorithm and the other the Recursive Fibonacci Algorithm. Clocks are implemented in both child processes to measure the run time of the calculations. The user inputs the numbers to be calculated. More details in README file.
